## User research and interviews

| Question | Interviewer 1 | Interviewer 2 | Interviewer 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
| Do you find it hard to understand? | Yes, the graph is easy to read | Yes, can understand easily | Yes, I understand at the first look |
| Do you think this article has good use of colors? | I would say average, it used colors but I did not find anything special | The color makes most of the graph look better as the attention is attracted to what the writer intended | It used colors in many places, the one in "top negative experience" is great, top stand out and draw people's attention |
| Which graph do you rate the best? | I like the "top negative experience" the best, it is very clear, and provide interesting information | I like the percentage graph as they gave me a very straight feeling | I like the "top negative experience" one. It is a simple graph, but I want to read more because the information is attracting. |
| Which graph do you rate the worst? | I do not like the animation of the ownership percentage change in 5 years. | Well, they are not bad. They played different roles. | I think is the ownership percentage change line graph. I do think they should appear in the first section where we talked about mobile population. They do not relate to the problem part. | 
| Do you think the data is supporting the context? | Overall yes, but the content seems very superficial. | They are close to what is said with the text. | Yes, I think they are good. | 
| What else do you want to see more? | As I said before, I want to see more findings that I never see before, so the article has deeper meaning to readers. | The problem part does not sounds like a real problem, so this would be hard to draw people's attention. | I want to see if you can add data visulization to each negative experience, to make the problem feel real. |

## Result and progress 

User research summary: Overall, the graph is easy to understand, and the readers can get the correct meaning. They also agree that the data visuals are supporting the text and help deliever the key ideas. However, several things need to change. 5-year ownership percentage trend is a good chart to many readers. Many pointed that they do not tell problems about mobile addition; they are just telling there are increasing trend and more phones, which is the first section content. Many people also read this article a bit simple and have few new information or findings. They would like to see more graphs in the last call for action section.

Changes made: I moved the "5-year ownership graph" to the first section. Not decided yet if I would change the line graph without animation.

Things to add in part-3: In part 3, I will add more details. First, in the problem part, I would add details about the problems. Hopefully, I can think of a way to add data visuals to each problem. Second, in the last part, I would try some creative way to represent the 3 things. Additionally, I would like to read some research, to see if I could add something about mental health, which would add value to this article. My initial target audience were young adult, because they are the group that has the highest ownership percentage. But in the problem and action part, I did not focus on their needs. I would try to make changes for them in part 3.
