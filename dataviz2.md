## Analysis
There are 3 different data visualizion generated from the same data sourse. However, they present different stories. In the first bar chart, we are able to compare the exact ratio value among all countries, but only in the recent year. This graph is more like a snapshot, but saying nothing about trend. Moving to the second graph, we are able to see the trends of each individual country, but I feel like it is hard to compare among countries. It is good to see details of each country, but hard to see as a whole. In the third country, I tried to compare country trends and more informatantly, give focus on the top 3 countries that have the highest ratio. Instead of using grid lines, I placed all lines in one graph, which provides better comparison. In this graph, I focus on comparison and top counties, so that I choose to sacrifice country details. I also removed countries that is either missing data or is just following a general trend. I assume they do not contribute much to the story, but removal of them can make graph look more clear.

In the third color, multiple colors are picked. To emphsize top 3 countries, I colored their lines with solid and strong color, and the rest lines with more pale color. Pale color lines only give some background information, but more attention is put on the top three only. I intended to make background less visible, as they just serve as reference.

The general story behind the graph is, Japan, Greece, and Italy are the top 3 countries with highest dept-to-gdp ratio. After around 2010, all of them have a continuous increase in the ratio, and their ratios are significantly higher than the major countries in the world.
