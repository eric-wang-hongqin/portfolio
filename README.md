This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Hi! My name is Eric, and I am a final-year master of information system student from Carnegie Mellon University. I like coding, and I am proficient in Python, Java, C, and Golang. I have accomplished course work and projects in database, distributed system, computer system and machine learning. I worked at Tencent as software engineer intern last summer, and I look forward to starting my career as software engineer after my graduation in May. 

# What I hope to learn
Data visualization is fun and that is why I can enjoy this course. Good data presentation is hard and that is why I want to learn. How to make data more interesting and more attracting is my most wish to accomplish in this course. 

After the course, I hope I'll be good at picking good chart types, colors, sizes, themes... Of course, I'll want to be proficient in making good visuals with software like Tableau.
