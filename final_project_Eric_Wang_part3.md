# Final Project, Part 3

## Part 1 Summary
In part 1, there are 2 major parts of work, one is searching and confirming the topic, and the other is exploring data access. Staticta is the major data sourses website for this project. Besides, I also made several draft graphs that might be useful. I also comfirmed I would use Shorthand to produce the story site and Flourish for data visulization.

## Part 2 Summary
In part 2, I started to make a draft on Shorthand, with adding all draft graphs. When making the draft story, I moved some section from back to frout, compared to part 1, to make the story flow more smooth. Afterwards, I interviewed 3 different persons to hear their feedback on my draft project. 

## Implement User Research
From the part 2 interviews, I can summarise 3 top issues or concerns from the users. First is they want to see more in dept analysis in the part 3. In the part 2, the story is very superficial and does not bring any insight. In part 3, I add individual description and analysis to each of neagetive impacts caused by mobile addiction. By doing so, I hope users can gain more knowledge on each neagetive impacts. 

The second problem is my story was to broad and does not focus on a group of people. So in the part 3, I make a decision to change my topic from talking about mobile problem for general people group to focus on people aged 18-29. When anaylising negative impacts, I only cover the influence to people aged 18-29, being student or young generation. When calling for action, I tried to related to what this age group of people care.

The third problem is the calling for action part is missing a lot of details and is very pain from part 2. So in part 3, I added more details to each action I am calling. For each call for action, I explained why we should do so and how we should follow to do.


## Thinking about Audience 
After making a major change in part 3 to focus on the people aged between 18 and 29, my target audience is fixed to the same group of people, or parents who are caring about someone in this age group. The reason I picked this group is they are the group of people that has the highest percentage of smartphone ownership and are suffering the most. Also, being in the same age group, I can contribute more personal feelings and understandings.
