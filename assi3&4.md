# GDP by State, 2021-2022

## Original Data Visulizaition
[World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/gdp-by-state) produced a data visulization on GDP per state in 2021-2022. The review was to introduce GDP and what GDP means in an economic entity, and highlight the top 10 states in US with the largest GDP number. The map is consit of lots of hex pieces, where each piece is representing one state. The 2-letter state name is labeled on the hex piece. Darker color is representing larger GDP. The label below the graph will change according to where your monse is on a single hex piece.

## Wireframe
In the first wireframe, I redesigned the map graph that presents GDP by State data to a real US map so the audience can have a straight link from the number to the state. Audience can tell where the state is (east, west or middle), how big is the state area, is state a border state or an inland state.

In the second wireframe, I designed to highlight the top 10 states with largest GDP. A pie chart can tell top 10 counts for more than half of country GDP, and how much percentage each state count of country GDP. However, bar chart is an alternative option that gives a more straight ranking and absolute amount of GDP.
