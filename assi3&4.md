# GDP by State, 2021-2022

## Original Data Visulizaition
[World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/gdp-by-state) produced a data visulization on GDP per state in 2021-2022. The review was to introduce GDP and what GDP means in an economic entity, and highlight the top 10 states in US with the largest GDP number.

## Wireframe
In the first wireframe, I tried to redesign the map GDP per State data to real US map so the audience can have a straight linking to the state. Audience can tell where the state is (east, west or middle), the state area, border state or inland state.

In the second wireframe, I tried to design to visualise the top 10 states with largest GDP. Top 10 counts for more than half of country GDP, and this can be seen from a pie graph. We can easily observe the percentage to country GDP from a pie graph. However, bar chart works to bring a more solid ranking and absolute numbers.
